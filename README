The download-mingw-rpm.py script makes it easy to download compiled binaries
from the windows:mingw[1] project on the OpenSUSE Build Service.

The script needs Python 3 and the 7z program in the path.  The 7z program is
available for POSIX platforms[2] and for Windows[3].  On Debian/Ubuntu derived
distros it's a `sudo apt-get install p7zip-full` away.


EXAMPLES
--------

Download and unpack and rpm from the windows:mingw:win32 project:

./download-mingw-rpm.py zlib

You'll now find a zlib1.dll file in a subdir of the current directory.


A more complicated example to make a zipfile containing pulseaudio with its
dependencies:

./download-mingw-rpm.py -p home:mkbosmans:mingw32:pulseaudio --deps -z pulseaudio
